# acids-dataset

`acids-dataset` is a preprocessing package for audio data and metadata, mostly used by [RAVE](http://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE) and [AFTER](http://github.com/acids-ircam/AFTER) but opened for custom use. Built open [lmdb](https://openldap.org/), it leverages the pre-processing step of data parsing required by audio generative models to extract metadata and audio features that can be accessed and used during training.
